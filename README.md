# Spoilers for NodeBB

Allows you to embed spoilers in NodeBB post content. Just use the following syntax, which is similar to that found on StackExchange.

```
>! spoiler text here
```

You can use this one for a more conventional Spoiler (as seen on phpbb).
```
>!! spoiler text here
```

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-spoilers
